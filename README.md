## SimpleStorage Contract

The `SimpleStorage` contract is a basic example of a smart contract written in Solidity, designed to run on the Ethereum blockchain. It demonstrates fundamental concepts of Ethereum smart contracts, such as state variables, structs, arrays, mappings, and functions.

### Features

#### 1. State Variable
   - `favouriteNumber`: A `uint256` state variable to store a favorite number.
   
#### 2. Struct
   - `People`: A struct representing a person, containing a `uint256` for the favorite number and a `string` for the person's name.
   
#### 3. Dynamic Array
   - `people`: A public dynamic array of `People` structs, allowing the storage of multiple people's information.
   
#### 4. Mapping
   - `nameToFavouriteNumber`: A mapping from a person's name (string) to their favorite number (uint256). This provides a quick way to retrieve a person's favorite number using their name.
   
#### 5. Functions
   - `store(uint256 _favouriteNumber)`: A public function that allows storing a favorite number in the `favouriteNumber` state variable.
   - `retrieve()`: A public view function that returns the stored favorite number. Since it's a view function, it doesn't modify the contract's state and can be called without making a transaction.
   - `addPerson(string memory _name, uint256 _favouriteNumber)`: A public function to add a person's information to the `people` array and update the `nameToFavouriteNumber` mapping.

### Version Information
The contract is written with a pragma directive to ensure it's compiled with a Solidity compiler version greater than or equal to 0.6.0 but less than 0.9.0.

### Licensing
The contract is released under the GNU General Public License v3.0, as indicated by the SPDX-License-Identifier comment at the top of the file.

### Usage
1. **Storing a Favorite Number**: Call the `store` function with a `uint256` argument to store a favorite number.
2. **Retrieving the Favorite Number**: Call the `retrieve` function to get the stored favorite number.
3. **Adding a Person**: Call the `addPerson` function with a name (string) and a favorite number (uint256) to add a personâ€™s information to the contract.
4. **Querying Information**: 
   - You can access the `people` array and the `nameToFavouriteNumber` mapping directly since they are public.
   - Use a person's index in the `people` array to retrieve their information.
   - Use a person's name as a key in the `nameToFavouriteNumber` mapping to get their favorite number.

### Conclusion
The `SimpleStorage` contract provides a basic example of how to interact with the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity. It demonstrates the use of various data types, functions, and solidity concepts, making it a great starting point for beginners looking to understand how smart contracts work.
